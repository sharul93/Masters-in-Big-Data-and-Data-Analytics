#On this first assignment, applying the basic functions of the Igraph package is required. The following datasets are #going to be #used:

#* Actors dataset - undirected graph - : For the 2005 Graph Drawing conference a data set was provided of the IMDB #movie database. 
#We will use a reduced version of this dataset, which derived all actor-actor collaboration edges where #the actors co-starred in at 
#least 2 movies together between 1995 and 2004. 

#You have to complete the code chunks in this document but also analyze the results, extract insights and answer the #short #questions. Fill the CSV attached with your answers, sometimes just the number is enough, some others just a #small sentence. Remember #to change the header with your email.

#In your submission please upload both the R Markdown and the CSV with the solutions.

# Loading data

#In this section, the goal is loading the datasets given, building the graph and analyzing basics metrics. Include the #edge or node attributes you consider.

#Describe the values provided by summary function on the graph object.
#*1) How many nodes are there?*
#*2) How many edges are there?*

```{r}
getwd()

library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

edges <- read_tsv("imdb_actor_edges.tsv")

# Degree distribution

#Analyse the degree distribution. Compute the total degree distribution.
#*3) How does this distributions look like?*
#*4) What is the maximum degree?*
#*5) What is the minimum degree?*

```{r}

     ylab = "frequency",

```
# Network Diameter and Average Path Length
#*6) What is the diameter of the graph?*
#*7) What is the avg path length of the graph?*

```{r}
diameter(g, directed = FALSE)

average.path.length(g, directed = FALSE)

```

# Node importance: Centrality measures

#Obtain the distribution of the number of movies made by an actor and the number of genres in which an actor starred in. It may be #useful to analyze and discuss the results to be obtained in the following exercises.

```{r}
V(g)
hist(V(g)$movies_95_04,
    main = "movies per actor",
    xlab = "number of movies",
    ylab = "frequency",
    labels = TRUE,
    col = "#296d98")

```

#Obtain three vectors with the degree, betweenness and closeness for each vertex of the actors' graph.

```{r}
deg <- degree(g)
head(deg, 5)

btw <- betweenness(g, v = V(g), normalized = TRUE)

head(cl, 5)

```

#Obtain the list of the 20 actors with the largest degree centrality. It can be useful to show a list with the degree, the name of #the actor, the number of movies, the main genre, and the number of genres in which the actor has participated.

#*8) Who is the actor with highest degree centrality?*
#*9) How do you explain the high degree of the top-20 list??*

#Network Models (Optional)
#Explore the ErdÃ¶s-Renyi model and compare its structural properties to those of real-world networks (actors):

```{r}

plot(g_er, vertex.label= key, edge.arrow.size=0.02,vertex.size = 0.5, xlab = "Random Network: G(N,L) model")

```

* Degree distribution  P(k)
* Network Diameter and Average Path Length
* (Global and Local) Clustering Coefficient

#Comunity detection (Optional)
#Use any community detection algorithm for the actors' network and discuss whether the communities found make sense #according to the #vertex labels.
